## Edu-Byte!

The platform is called Edu-Byte and I don't expect it to be out of speculation until after a few years of development. My plan for this platform is to build an opensource, people focused educational website that will provide material and resources that will help someone learn any language they'd like.

Well saying any language they'd like gives me anxiety considering I'm the only person working on it at the moment, but I hope to expand with others as the idea becomes more clear.

## Content Plan

In the early preview I plan on creating content on languages like Rust, Zig and C, which I am comfortable with, and I hope to get others to help me on different languages. At the moment I am writing `Zig Unleashed` which will be the first book written for this platform.

To explain the different content planned for this platform, it might make sense to look at a little diagram based on the code written for `edubyte-metadata`:

```
Free => Article Types/ 
           Topic 
           How to Guides 
           News 
           TrainLings 
Paid => Paid Types/ 
           Udemy courses 
           Ebooks / Book (distr. Amazon) 
```

In terms of paid content I have planned for 5 different price tiers ($CAD) that a book could fall in, this depends on the type of content it covers and its length. (These are exclusive ranges)

- Tier 1: $19.99 - $35.99
- Tier 2: $35.99 - $40.99
- Tier 3: $40.99 - $49.99
- Tier 4: $49.99 - $69.99
- Tier 5: $69.99 - $99.99

## Licenses

All tools and code written for this project are planned to be under the [GPLv2](gpl-2.0.md) license while books will be under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Personally I don't have problems with any pirating of my books, so this license will allow you to do distribute it without adaptation and for noncommercial purposes.
